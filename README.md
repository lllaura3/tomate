This is a repository with timers. 
Most of them have pop up windows and sounds which are activated when time is up.

<h3><b>tomato_html</b></h3> is a timer similar to the pomodoro timer. It's made for work and tasks, so it has messages to say thats work time or break time. The background colour changes when it's break time. If you want to use it for other things, I would recommend you use ess.html which is more generic.
Default when you just press [start], is 25 minutes. 
But you can change the time in the <b>sliding bar</b> until 60 minutes maximum and 1 minute minimum. 
Break time can be set also in the number box.

<h3><b>countdown.html</b></h3> is a countdown for specific time-day-seconds.
You can change the time on line 50.

<h3><b>ess.html</b></h3> simplified version of tomato_html. Works better.
Time can be set between one minute minimum until 160 minutes maximum.
